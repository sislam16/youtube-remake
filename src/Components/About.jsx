        <p>This app fetches YouTube videos using the YouTube API. Users are able to make a search query inside of the input box on the homepage and 8 videos from the search will populate on the page feed. When a video is clicked, the video component will enlarge and allow users to watch the video and leave comments below like the original YouTube page. This was built by Suzette. </p>
